# Copy this sample file next to the binary to test (e.g. in "./target/release")

# It is a simplified version of installer/docker/config/log.toml with addition
# of "aws" appender and "vault_stats" logger using it.

# "async_file" appender was removed because even if it was not used some
# empty Node-nnn.log files were created.

# If set, log4rs will scan the file at the specified rate in seconds for
# changes and automatically reconfigure the loggers.
